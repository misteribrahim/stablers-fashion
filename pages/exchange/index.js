                    <h5>Refunds</h5>
                    <p>Once we have received your return, we will examine the items to assess their condition before issuing a refund. Any products that are not returned in the same new and unworn condition may result in a charge that is deducted from the refund, or risk being rejected altogether.</p>
                    <p>Once the refund has been authorised, you will receive an email confirming it has been processed and the value to be credited.</p>
                    <p>Refunds will be issued against the same payment method used for the original purchase and in the same currency, less the initial outbound shipping and any subsequent return shipping costs as detailed on this page under How to Return Your Order. Typically payments will be refunded within 72 hours of being processed, but this could take up to 10 business days to show in your account. </p>
